## What is Version Control?

<q>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</q>

## What is Version Control?

* Many of us constantly create something, save it, change it, then save it again
* Version (or revision) control is a means of managing this process in a reliable and efficient way
* Especially important when collaborating with others

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control)

## What is Git?

<q>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</q>

## What is Git?

* Created by the same people who developed Linux
* The most popular implementation of version control today
* Everything is stored in local repositories on your computer
* Operated from the command line

## Download Git

* Go to the following website and click on the download link for your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc):

[http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install Git

* Once the file is done downloading, open it up to begin the Git installation

---

## Install Git

* Unless you really know what you are doing, just go with the default options at each step of the installation

* Once the install is complete, hit the "Finish" button (you may want to uncheck the box next to "Review ReleaseNotes.rtf")

## Open Git Bash

* Find a program called Git Bash, which is the command line environment for interacting with Git
* It should be located in the directory into which Git was installed (or, for Windows users, in the Start Menu)

---

## Open Git Bash

* Once Git Bash opens, you'll see a short welcome message followed by the name of your computer and a dollar sign on the next line
* The dollar sign means that it's your turn to type a command

## Configure Username and Email

* Each commit to a Git repository will be "tagged" with the username of the person who made the commit
* Enter the following commands in Git Bash, one at a time, to set your username and email:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

* You'll only have to do this once, but you can always change these down the road using the same commands

---

## Configure Username and Email

* Now type the following to confirm your changes (they may be listed toward the bottom):

```
$ git config --list
```

## What's Next?

* Go ahead and close Git Bash with following command:

```
$ exit
```

* Now that Git is set up on your computer, we're ready to move on to GitHub, which is a web-based platform that lets you do some pretty cool stuff
* Once GitHub is up and running, we'll show you how to start using these tools to your benefit

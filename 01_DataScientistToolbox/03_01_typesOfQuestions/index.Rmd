## Types of Data Science Questions

__In approximate order of difficulty__
* Descriptive
* Exploratory
* Inferential
* Predictive
* Causal
* Mechanistic


---

## About descriptive analyses
__Goal__: Describe a set of data

* The first kind of data analysis performed
* Commonly applied to census data
* The description and interpretation are different steps
* Descriptions can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling


---


## Descriptive analysis

## About exploratory analysis

__Goal__: Find relationships you didn't know about

* Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections
* They are also useful for defining future studies
* Exploratory analyses are usually not the final say
* Exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting
* [Correlation does not imply causation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation)

## Exploratory analysis

## Exploratory analysis

---

## About inferential analysis

__Goal__: Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population

* Inference is commonly the goal of statistical models
* Inference involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainty about your estimate
* Inference depends heavily on both the population and the sampling scheme

---

## Inferential analysis

[Correia et al. (2013) Epidemiology](http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2013/01000/Effect_of_Air_Pollution_Control_on_Life_Expectancy.4.aspx)


---

## About predictive analysis

__Goal__: To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object

* If $X$ predicts $Y$ it does not mean that $X$ causes $Y$
* Accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables
* Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model [works really well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvDCzhbjYWs)
* Prediction is very hard, especially about the future [references](http://www.larry.denenberg.com/predictions.html)

## Predictive analysis

## Predictive analysis

---

## About causal analysis

__Goal__: To find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change. 

* Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation
* There are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
* Causal relationships are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual
* Causal models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis

## Causal analysis

[van Nood et al. (2013) NEJM](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1205037?query=featured_home)

---

## About mechanistic analysis

__Goal__: Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.

* Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
* Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations (physical/engineering science)
* Generally the random component of the data is measurement error
* If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis

## Mechanistic analysis

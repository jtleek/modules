## Reading Lines of a Text File

`readLines` can be useful for reading in lines of webpages

```r
## This might take time
con <- url("http://www.jhsph.edu", "r")
x <- readLines(con)
> head(x)
[1] "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">"
[2] ""
[3] "<html>"
[4] "<head>"
[5] "\t<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8
```

## Somethingâ€™s Wrong!

How do you know that something is wrong with your function? 
- What was your input? How did you call the function?
- What were you expecting? Output, messages, other results? 
- What did you get?
- How does what you get differ from what you were expecting? 
- Were your expectations correct in the first place?
- Can you reproduce the problem (exactly)?

## lapply

`lapply` takes three arguments: a list `X`, a function (or the name of a function) `FUN`, and other arguments via its ... argument. If `X` is not a list, it will be coerced to a list using `as.list`.

```r
> lapply
function (X, FUN, ...)
{
    FUN <- match.fun(FUN)
    if (!is.vector(X) || is.object(X))
        X <- as.list(X)
    .Internal(lapply(X, FUN))
}
```

The actual looping is done internally in C code.

## Pre-requisites
* There are no formal pre-requisites
* But all data analysis will be performed in the R programming language: [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)
* You can find some videos on how to install R here: [http://bit.ly/UCJI9M](http://bit.ly/UCJI9M).
* Having a very basic knowledge of R will make the class much more accessible
* If you want to assess your knowledge, take this self-graded R pre-quiz: [http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/coursera/selfquiz/](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/coursera/selfquiz/) (this quiz does not count toward your final grade for Data Analysis)
  1. Give yourself 1 point for each correct answer. 
  2. If it takes you less than 1 hour and you get a score of 10 or higher you should have no trouble with the level of R in the course
  3. If it takes you more than 1 hour or your score is less than 10, you might want to check out course videos for Computing for Data Analysis here: [http://bit.ly/UC5UDc](http://bit.ly/UC5UDc)

## Why R?

* It is free. 
* It is the most popular language for data analysis.
* Typing is better than point-and-click
  * Easier to communicate
  * Reproducible
  * Requires more thought
* It has a huge number of useful packages (as you will see)

---

## Course Structure

* My goal is to make all videos 10-15 minutes
* Several topics may be broken down into sub-components
* R code will be included in the slides
* Slides will be availble in pdf and html form. 

---

## Grading

* There will be a total of 8 weekly quizzes each worth 10 points. 
* There will be two peer-reviewed data analysis reports worth 40 points each. 
* There are 160 total points for the course
* To earn the certificate for the course you need to earn 100 points. 
* To earn distinction for the course you need to earn 144 points. 

---

## Grading

* You may attempt each quiz up to 4 times. Only the last attempt will count. 

* The data analysis you submit will be scored by your peers using a defined rubric. Your final score for the data analysis will be the median of the peer review scores. 

* You have up to 5 late days during the course of the term, which you may use on the quizzes. 

* You may not use [late days](http://help.coursera.org/customer/portal/articles/502593-how-much-work-should-i-expect-from-one-class-) on the peer-reviewed assignements.

* See the course logistics page for assignment due dates.

## Scoring for the data analysis assignments

* You will get one week after the data analysis deadline to complete peer review of the assignment. 

* Each data analysis assignment has four parts: the main text, a figure and caption, the references and R code. 

* Each part will be scored on multiple criteria.

* When grading your peers you will give 0-5 points for each criteria.

* The final score will be the percentage of available points multiplied by 40.

## Data analysis rubric
__Main text__
* Does the analysis have an introduction, methods, analysis, and conclusions? 
* Are figures labeled and referred to by number in the text? 
* Is the analysis written in grammatically correct English?
* Are the names of variables reported in plain language, rather than in coded names?
* Does the analysis report the number of samples?
* Does the analysis report any missing data or other unusual features?
* Does the analysis include a discussion of potential confounders?
* Are the statistical models appropriately applied?
* Are estimates reported with appropriate units and measures of uncertainty?
* Are estimators/predictions appropriately interpreted?
* Does the analysis make concrete conclusions?
* Does the analysis specify potential problems with the conclusions? 

---
## Data analysis rubric

__Figure__
* Is the figure caption descriptive enough to stand alone?
* Does the figure focus on a key issue in the processing/modeling of the data?
* Are axes labeled and are the labels large enough to read?

__References__
* Does the analysis include references for the statistical methods used?

__R script__

* Can the analysis be reproduced with the code provided?

## Typos/errors/differences of opinion

* I'm prone to a typo or two
* This is my first time giving video lectures
* I'm happy to get feedback in the "Feedback" forum
* I'll try to address as many of the issues as I can
* Keep in mind that currently data analysis is as much art as it is science.

## Getting the slides

* Slides for this course were created with Slidify: [http://ramnathv.github.com/slidify/](http://ramnathv.github.com/slidify/). 
* They are available from [https://github.com/jtleek/dataanalysis](https://github.com/jtleek/dataanalysis).
* To re-compile the slides:
  1. Download the directory containing the lecture from Github
  2. Set the working directory to the lecture directory
  3. [Install Slidify](http://slidify.org/start)
  4. Run the following commands: 
  
```{r slidifyChunk, eval=FALSE}
library(slidify) 
slidify("index.Rmd")
```

## Asking questions

* __In a standard class__
  * There are 30-100 people
  * You raise your hand and ask a question
  * The instructor responds 
* __In a MOOC__
  * There are almost 100,000 people
  * You post a question to the message board
  * Others vote on your questions
  * Your instructor responds (as often as possible)
  * Your peers respond (as often as possible)

## Often the fastest answer is the one you find yourself

* It's important to try to answer your own questions first
* If the answer to your question is in the help file or the top hit on Google, the answer to your question will be, "Read the documentation" or "Google it"
* If you figure out the answer and see the same questions on the forum, post the solution you found

---

## Where to look for different types of questions

* R programming (see also: [http://bit.ly/Ufaadn](http://bit.ly/Ufaadn))
  * Search the archive of the class forums
  * Read the manual/help files
  * Search on the web 
  * Ask a skilled friend
  * Post to the class forums
  * Post to the [R mailing list](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html) or [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* Data Analysis/Statistics
  * Search the archive of the class forums
  * Search on the web
  * Ask a skilled friend
  * Post to the class forums
  * Post to [CrossValidated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)

## Some important R functions

__Access help file__
```{r,tidy=FALSE}

?rnorm

```

__Search help files__
```{r}
help.search("rnorm")
```

__Get arguments__
```{r}
args("rnorm")
```

---

## Some important R functions
__See code__
```{r}
rnorm
```

__R reference card__

## How to ask an R question
* What steps will reproduce the problem?
* What is the expected output? 
* What do you see instead?
* What version of the product (e.g. R, packages, etc.) 
are you using?
* What operating system? 

---

## How to ask a data analysis question
* What is the question you are trying to answer?
* What steps/tools did you use to answer it?
* What did you expect to see?
* What do you see instead?
* What other solutions have you thought about?

---

## Be specific in the title of your questions

* Bad:
  * HELP! Can't fit linear model!
  * HELP! Don't understand PCA!

* Better
  * R 2.15.0 lm() function produces seg fault with large data frame, Mac OS X 
10.6.3 
  * Applied principal component analysis to a matrix - what are U, D, and $V^T$?

* Even better
  * R 2.15.0 lm() function on Mac OS X 10.6.3 -- seg fault on large data frame
  * Using principal components to discover common variation in rows of a matrix, should I use U, D or $V^T$?

## Etiquette for forums/help sites: DOs 

* Describe the goal
* Be explicit
* Provide the minimum information
* Be courteous (never hurts)
* Follow up and post solutions
* Use the forums rather than email

---

## Etiquette for forums/help sites: DON'Ts

* Immediately assume you found a bug
* Grovel as a substitute for doing your work
* Post homework questions on mailing lists (people don't like doing your homework)
* Email multiple mailing lists at once/the wrong mailing list
* Ask others to fix your code without explaining the problem
* Ask about general data analysis questions on R forums.

---

## A note on Googling data analysis questions

* The best place to start for general questions is our forum
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/),[R mailing list](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html) for software questions, [CrossValidated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) for more general questions
* Otherwise Google "[data type] data analysis" or "[data type] R package"
* Try to identify what data analysis is called for your data type
  * [Biostatistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostatistics) for medical data
  * [Data Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) for data from web analytics
  * [Machine learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) for data in computer science/computer vision
  * [Natural language processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing ) for data from texts
  * [Signal processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing) for data from electrical signals
  * [Business analytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analytics) for data on customers
  * [Econometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) for economic data
  * [Statistical process control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control) for data about industrial processes 
  * etc.

## A Diversion on Binding Values to Symbol

How does R know which value to assign to which symbol? When I type

```r
> lm <- function(x) { x * x }
> lm
function(x) { x * x }
```

how does R know what value to assign to the symbol `lm`? Why doesn’t it give it the value of `lm` that is in the *stats* package?

---

## A Diversion on Binding Values to Symbol

When R tries to bind a value to a symbol, it searches through a series of `environments` to find the appropriate value. When you are working on the command line and need to retrieve the value of an R object, the order is roughly

1. Search the global environment for a symbol name matching the one requested.
2. Search the namespaces of each of the packages on the search list

The search list can be found by using the `search` function.

```r
> search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics"
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base"
```

---

## Binding Values to Symbol

- The _global environment_ or the user’s workspace is always the first element of the search list and the *base* package is always the last.
- The order of the packages on the search list matters!
- User’s can configure which packages get loaded on startup so you cannot assume that there will be a set list of packages available.
- When a user loads a package with `library` the namespace of that package gets put in position 2 of the search list (by default) and everything else gets shifted down the list.
- Note that R has separate namespaces for functions and non-functions so it’s possible to have an object named c and a function named c.

## Scoping Rules

The scoping rules for R are the main feature that make it di↵erent from the original S language.

- The scoping rules determine how a value is associated with a free variable in a function
- R uses _lexical scoping_ or _static scoping_. A common alternative is _dynamic scoping_. 
- Related to the scoping rules is how R uses the search _list_ to bind a value to a
symbol
- Lexical scoping turns out to be particularly useful for simplifying statistical computations

---

## Lexical Scoping

Consider the following function.

```r
f <- function(x, y) {
        x^2 + y / z
}
```

This function has 2 formal arguments `x` and `y`. In the body of the function there is another symbol `z`. In this case `z` is called a _free variable_.
The scoping rules of a language determine how values are assigned to free variables. Free variables are not formal arguments and are not local variables (assigned insided the function body).

---

## Lexical Scoping

Lexical scoping in R means that

_the values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined_.

What is an environment?

- An _environment_ is a collection of (symbol, value) pairs, i.e. `x` is a symbol and `3.14` might be its value.
- Every environment has a parent environment; it is possible for an environment to have multiple “children”
- the only environment without a parent is the empty environment 
- A function + an environment = a _closure_ or _function closure_.

---

## Lexical Scoping

Searching for the value for a free variable:

- If the value of a symbol is not found in the environment in which a function was defined, then the search is continued in the _parent environment_.
- The search continues down the sequence of parent environments until we hit the _top-level environment_; this usually the global environment (workspace) or the namespace of a package.
- After the top-level environment, the search continues down the search list until we hit the _empty environment_.
If a value for a given symbol cannot be found once the empty environment is arrived at, then an error is thrown.

---

## Lexical Scoping

Why does all this matter?

- Typically, a function is defined in the global environment, so that the values of free variables are just found in the user’s workspace
- This behavior is logical for most people and is usually the “right thing” to do 
- However, in R you can have functions defined _inside other functions_
  - Languages like C don’t let you do this
- Now things get interesting — In this case the environment in which a function is defined is the body of another function!

---

## Lexical Scoping

```r
make.power <- function(n) {
        pow <- function(x) {
                x^n 
        }
        pow 
}
```

This function returns another function as its value.

```r
> cube <- make.power(3)
> square <- make.power(2)
> cube(3)
[1] 27
> square(3)
[1] 9
```

---

## Exploring a Function Closure

What’s in a function’s environment?

```r
> ls(environment(cube))
[1] "n"   "pow"
> get("n", environment(cube))
[1] 3

> ls(environment(square))
[1] "n"   "pow"
> get("n", environment(square))
[1] 2
```

---

## Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping

```r
y <- 10

f <- function(x) {
        y <- 2
        y^2 + g(x)
}

g <- function(x) { 
        x*y
}
```

What is the value of

```r
f(3)
```

---

## Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping

- With lexical scoping the value of `y` in the function `g` is looked up in the environment in which the function was defined, in this case the global environment, so the value of `y` is 10.
- With dynamic scoping, the value of `y` is looked up in the environment from which the function was _called_ (sometimes referred to as the _calling environment_).
  - In R the calling environment is known as the _parent frame_ 
- So the value of `y` would be 2.

---

## Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping

When a function is _defined_ in the global environment and is subsequently _called_ from the global environment, then the defining environment and the calling environment are the same. This can sometimes give the appearance of dynamic scoping.

```r
> g <- function(x) { 
+ a <- 3
+ x+a+y 
+ }
> g(2)
Error in g(2) : object "y" not found
> y <- 3
> g(2)
[1] 8
```

---

## Other Languages

Other languages that support lexical scoping 
- Scheme
- Perl
- Python
- Common Lisp (all languages converge to Lisp)

---

## Consequences of Lexical Scoping

- In R, all objects must be stored in memory
- All functions must carry a pointer to their respective defining environments, which could be anywhere
- In S-PLUS, free variables are always looked up in the global workspace, so everything can be stored on the disk because the “defining environment” of all functions is the same.

---

## Application: Optimization

Why is any of this information useful?
- Optimization routines in R like `optim`, `nlm`, and `optimize` require you to pass a function whose argument is a vector of parameters (e.g. a log-likelihood)
- However, an object function might depend on a host of other things besides its parameters (like _data_)
- When writing software which does optimization, it may be desirable to allow the user to hold certain parameters fixed

---

## Maximizing a Normal Likelihood

Write a “constructor” function

```r
make.NegLogLik <- function(data, fixed=c(FALSE,FALSE)) {
        params <- fixed
        function(p) {
                params[!fixed] <- p
                mu <- params[1]
                sigma <- params[2]
                a <- -0.5*length(data)*log(2*pi*sigma^2)
                b <- -0.5*sum((data-mu)^2) / (sigma^2)
                -(a + b)
        } 
}
```
*Note*: Optimization functions in R _minimize_ functions, so you need to use the negative log-likelihood.

---

## Maximizing a Normal Likelihood

```r
> set.seed(1); normals <- rnorm(100, 1, 2)
> nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals)
> nLL
function(p) {
                params[!fixed] <- p
                mu <- params[1]
                sigma <- params[2]
                a <- -0.5*length(data)*log(2*pi*sigma^2)
                b <- -0.5*sum((data-mu)^2) / (sigma^2)
                -(a + b)
        }
<environment: 0x165b1a4>
> ls(environment(nLL))
[1] "data"   "fixed"  "params"
```

---

## Estimating Parameters

```r
> optim(c(mu = 0, sigma = 1), nLL)$par
      mu    sigma
1.218239 1.787343
```

Fixing σ = 2

```r
> nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(FALSE, 2))
> optimize(nLL, c(-1, 3))$minimum
[1] 1.217775
```

Fixing μ = 1

```r
> nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(1, FALSE))
> optimize(nLL, c(1e-6, 10))$minimum
[1] 1.800596
```

---

## Plotting the Likelihood

```r
nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(1, FALSE))
x <- seq(1.7, 1.9, len = 100)
y <- sapply(x, nLL)
plot(x, exp(-(y - min(y))), type = "l")

nLL <- make.NegLogLik(normals, c(FALSE, 2))
x <- seq(0.5, 1.5, len = 100)
y <- sapply(x, nLL)
plot(x, exp(-(y - min(y))), type = "l")
```

## Lexical Scoping Summary

- Objective functions can be “built” which contain all of the necessary data for evaluating the function
- No need to carry around long argument lists — useful for interactive and exploratory work.
- Code can be simplified and cleand up

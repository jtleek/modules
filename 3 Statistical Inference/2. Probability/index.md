## Probability measures

A **probability measure**, $P$, is a real valued function from the collection of possible events so that the following hold

1. For an event $E\subset \Omega$, $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$
3. If $E_1$ and $E_2$ are mutually exclusive events
  $P(E_1 \cup E_2) = P(E_1) + P(E_2)$.

---

## Additivity

Part 3 of the definition implies **finite additivity**

$$
P(\cup_{i=1}^n A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)
$$
where the $\{A_i\}$ are mutually exclusive.

This is usually extended to **countable additivity**
$$
P(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)
$$

---

## Note

- $P$ is defined on ${\cal F}$ a collection of subsets of $\Omega$
- Example $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3\}$ then
$$
{\cal F} = \left\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\} ,\{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\right\}.
$$
- When $\Omega$ is a continuous set, the definition gets much trickier. In this case we
  assume that ${\cal F}$ is sufficiently rich so that any set that we're interested in will
  be in it.

---

## Consequences

You should be able to prove all of the following:
- $P(\emptyset) = 0$
- $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
- if $A \subset B$ then $P(A) \leq P(B)$
- $P\left(A \cup B\right) = 1 - P(A^c \cap B^c)$
- $P(A \cap B^c) = P(A) - P(A \cap B)$
- $P(\cup_{i=1}^n E_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)$
- $P(\cup_{i=1}^n E_i) \geq \max_i P(E_i)$

---

## Example

Proof that $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
1 & = & P(\Omega) \\
  & = & P(E \cup E^c)\\
  & = & P(E) + P(E^c)
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

$\blacksquare$

---

## Example

Proof that $P(\cup_{i=1}^n E_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)$

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  P(E_1 \cup E_2) & =   & P(E_1) + P(E_2) - P(E_1 \cap E_2) \\
                  &\leq & P(E_1) + P(E_2)
\end{eqnarray*}
$$

Assume the statement is true for $n-1$ and consider $n$

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  P(\cup_{i=1}^n E_i) & \leq & P(E_n) + P(\cup_{i=1}^{n-1} E_i) \\
                      & \leq & P(E_n) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} P(E_i) \\
                      & =    & \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
$\blacksquare$

## Example

The National Sleep Foundation ([www.sleepfoundation.org](http://www.sleepfoundation.org/)) reports that around 3% of the American population has sleep apnea. They also report that around 10% of the North American and European population has restless leg syndrome. Similarly, they report that 58% of adults in the US experience insomnia. Does this imply that 71% of people will have at least one sleep problems of these sorts?

---

## Example continued

Answer: No, the events are not mutually exclusive. To elaborate let:

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    A_1 & = & \{\mbox{Person has sleep apnea}\} \\
    A_2 & = & \{\mbox{Person has RLS}\} \\
    A_3 & = & \{\mbox{Person has insomnia}\}
  \end{eqnarray*}
$$

Then (work out the details for yourself)

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
    P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3) & = & P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) \\
   & - & P(A_1 \cap A_2) - P(A_1 \cap A_3) - P(A_2 \cap A_3) \\
   & + & P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap A_3) \\
   & = & .71 + \mbox{Other stuff}
  \end{eqnarray*}
$$

where the "Other stuff"" has to be less than $0$

## Random variables

- A **random variable** is a numerical outcome of an experiment.
- The random variables that we study will come in two varieties,
  **discrete** or **continuous**.
- Discrete random variable are random variables that take on only a
countable number of possibilities.
  * $P(X = k)$
- Continuous random variable can take any value on the real line or some subset of the real line.
  * $P(X \in A)$

---

## Examples of variables that can be thought of as random variables

- The $(0-1)$ outcome of the flip of a coin
- The outcome from the roll of a die
- The BMI of a subject four years after a baseline measurement
- The hypertension status of a subject randomly drawn from a population

---

## PMF

A probability mass function evaluated at a value corresponds to the
probability that a random variable takes that value. To be a valid
pmf a function, $p$, must satisfy

  1. $p(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
  2. $\sum_{x} p(x) = 1$

The sum is taken over all of the possible values for $x$.

---

## Example

Let $X$ be the result of a coin flip where $X=0$ represents
tails and $X = 1$ represents heads.
$$
p(x) = (1/2)^{x} (1/2)^{1-x} ~~\mbox{ for }~~x = 0,1
$$
Suppose that we do not know whether or not the coin is fair; Let
$\theta$ be the probability of a head expressed as a proportion
(between 0 and 1).
$$
p(x) = \theta^{x} (1 - \theta)^{1-x} ~~\mbox{ for }~~x = 0,1
$$

---

## Example

For the unfair coin

$p(0) = 1 - \theta$ and $p(1) = \theta$

so

$p(x) > 0$ for $x=0,1$

and

$p(0) + p(1) = \theta + (1 - \theta) = 1$

---

## PDF

A probability density function (pdf), is a function associated with
a continuous random variable 

  *Areas under pdfs correspond to probabilities for that random variable*

To be a valid pdf, a function $f$ must satisfy

1. $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$

2. $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx = 1$

---

## Example

Assume that the time in years from diagnosis until death of persons
with a specific kind of cancer follows a density like
$$
f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
    \frac{e^{-x/5}}{5} & \mbox{ for } x > 0 \\
    0                 & \mbox{ otherwise} 
\end{array} \right. 
$$
More compactly written: $f(x) = \frac{1}{5}e^{-x/5}$ for $x>0$.

Is this a valid density?

1. $e$ raised to any power is always positive
2. $$
\int_{0}^\infty f(x) dx = \int_{0}^\infty e^{-x/5} / 5 dx = \left. -e^{-x/5} \right|^{\infty}_0 = 1
$$

---

## Example continued

Whatâ€™s the probability that a randomly selected person from this distribution survives more than 6 years?

---

## Example continued

What's the probability that a randomly selected person from this distribution survives more than 6 years?
$$
P(X \geq 6) = \int_6^\infty  \frac{e^{-t/5}}{5}dt =  \left. -e^{-t/5} \right|_{6}^\infty = e^{-6/5} \approx .301.
$$

Approximation in R 

```r
pexp(6, 1/5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## CDF and survival function

- The **cumulative distribution function** (CDF) of a random variable $X$ is defined as the function 
$$
F(x) = P(X \leq x)
$$
- This definition applies regardless of whether $X$ is discrete or continuous.
- The **survival function** of a random variable $X$ is defined as
$$
S(x) = P(X > x)
$$
- Notice that $S(x) = 1 - F(x)$
- For continuous random variables, the PDF is the derivative of the CDF

## Example

What are the survival function and CDF from the exponential density considered before?

---

## Example

What are the survival function and CDF from the exponential density considered before?
$$
S(x) = \int_x^\infty  \frac{e^{-t/5}}{5}dt =  \left. -e^{-t/5} \right|_{x}^\infty = e^{-x/5}
$$
hence we know that
$$
F(x) = 1 - S(x) = 1 - e^{-x/5}
$$
Notice that we can recover the PDF by
$$
f(x) = F'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} (1 -  e^{-x/5}) = e^{-x/5}/5
$$

---

## Quantiles

- The  $\alpha^{th}$ **quantile** of a distribution with distribution function $F$ is the point $x_\alpha$ so that
$$
F(x_\alpha) = \alpha
$$
- A **percentile** is simply a quantile with $\alpha$ expressed as a percent
- The **median** is the $50^{th}$ percentile

---

---

## Example

What is the $25^{th}$ percentile of the exponential survival distribution considered before?

---

- What is the $25^{th}$ percentile of the exponential survival distribution considered before?
- We want to solve (for $x$)
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
.25 & = & F(x) \\  
    & = & 1 - e^{-x/5}
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
resulting in the solution $x = -\log(.75) \times 5 \approx 1.44$
- Therefore, 25\% of the subjects from this population live less than 1.44 years
- R can approximate exponential quantiles for you

```r
qexp(.25, 1/5)
```

---

## Summary

- You might be wondering at this point "I've heard of a median before, it didn't require integration. Where's the data?"
- We're referring to are **population quantities**. Therefore, the median being
  discussed is the **population median**.
- A probability model connects the data to the population using assumptions.
- Therefore the median we're discussing is the **estimand**, the sample median will be the **estimator**

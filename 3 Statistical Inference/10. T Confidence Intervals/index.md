## Independent group $t$ confidence intervals

- Suppose that we want to compare the mean blood pressure between two groups in a randomized trial; those who received the treatment to those who received a placebo
- We cannot use the paired t test because the groups are independent and may have different sample sizes
- We now present methods for comparing independent groups

---

## Notation

- Let $X_1,\ldots,X_{n_x}$ be iid $N(\mu_x,\sigma^2)$
- Let $Y_1,\ldots,Y_{n_y}$ be iid $N(\mu_y, \sigma^2)$
- Let $\bar X$, $\bar Y$, $S_x$, $S_y$ be the means and standard deviations
- Using the fact that linear combinations of normals are again normal, we know that $\bar Y - \bar X$ is also normal with mean $\mu_y - \mu_x$ and variance $\sigma^2 (\frac{1}{n_x} + \frac{1}{n_y})$
- The pooled variance estimator $$S_p^2 = \{(n_x - 1) S_x^2 + (n_y - 1) S_y^2\}/(n_x + n_y - 2)$$ is a good estimator of $\sigma^2$

---

## Note

- The pooled estimator is a mixture of the group variances, placing greater weight on whichever has a larger sample size
- If the sample sizes are the same the pooled variance estimate is the average of the group variances
- The pooled estimator is unbiased
$$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    E[S_p^2] & = & \frac{(n_x - 1) E[S_x^2] + (n_y - 1) E[S_y^2]}{n_x + n_y - 2}\\
            & = & \frac{(n_x - 1)\sigma^2 + (n_y - 1)\sigma^2}{n_x + n_y - 2}
    \end{eqnarray*}
$$
- The pooled variance  estimate is independent of $\bar Y - \bar X$ since $S_x$ is independent of $\bar X$ and $S_y$ is independent of $\bar Y$ and the groups are independent

---

## Result

- The sum of two independent Chi-squared random variables is Chi-squared with degrees of freedom equal to the sum of the degrees of freedom of the summands
- Therefore
$$
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      (n_x + n_y - 2) S_p^2 / \sigma^2 & = & (n_x - 1)S_x^2 /\sigma^2 + (n_y - 1)S_y^2/\sigma^2 \\ \\
      & = & \chi^2_{n_x - 1} + \chi^2_{n_y-1} \\ \\
      & = & \chi^2_{n_x + n_y - 2}
    \end{eqnarray*}
$$

## Putting this all together

- The statistic
$$
    \frac{\frac{\bar Y - \bar X - (\mu_y - \mu_x)}{\sigma \left(\frac{1}{n_x} + \frac{1}{n_y}\right)^{1/2}}}%
    {\sqrt{\frac{(n_x + n_y - 2) S_p^2}{(n_x + n_y - 2)\sigma^2}}}
    = \frac{\bar Y - \bar X - (\mu_y - \mu_x)}{S_p \left(\frac{1}{n_x} + \frac{1}{n_y}\right)^{1/2}}
$$
is a standard normal divided by the square root of an independent Chi-squared divided by its degrees of freedom 
- Therefore this statistic follows Gosset's $t$ distribution with $n_x + n_y - 2$ degrees of freedom
- Notice the form is (estimator - true value) / SE

---

## Confidence interval

- Therefore a $(1 - \alpha)\times 100\%$ confidence interval for $\mu_y - \mu_x$ is 
$$
    \bar Y - \bar X \pm t_{n_x + n_y - 2, 1 - \alpha/2}S_p\left(\frac{1}{n_x} + \frac{1}{n_y}\right)^{1/2}
$$
- Remember this interval is assuming a constant variance across the two groups
- If there is some doubt, assume a different variance per group, which we will discuss later

---

## Likelihood method

- Exactly as before, 
$$
    \frac{\bar Y - \bar X}{S_p \left(\frac{1}{n_x} + \frac{1}{n_y}\right)^{1/2}}
$$
follows a non-central $t$ distribution with non-centrality parameter $\frac{\mu_y - \mu_x}{\sigma  \left(\frac{1}{n_x} + \frac{1}{n_y}\right)^{1/2}}$
- Therefore, we can use this statistic to create a likelihood for $(\mu_y - \mu_x) / \sigma$, a standardized measure of the change in group means

## Example

- Comparing SBP for 8 oral contraceptive users versus 21 controls
- $\bar X_{OC} = 132.86$ mmHg with $s_{OC} = 15.34$ mmHg
- $\bar X_{C} = 127.44$ mmHg with $s_{C} = 18.23$ mmHg
- Pooled variance estimate
$$
s_p^2 = \frac{7 (15.34)^2 + 20 (18.23)^2}{8 + 21 - 2} = 307.8
$$ 
- $t_{27,.975} = 2.052$ (in R, `qt(.975, df = 27)`)
- Interval
$$
132.86 - 127.44 \pm 2.052 \left\{307.8 \left( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{21}\right)^{1/2} \right\}
= [-9.52, 20.36]
$$

## Likelihood plot for the effect size

Reasonable values for the effect size from the confidence interval
$$
[-9.52, 20.36] / sp = [-.54, 1.16]

## Unequal variances

- Note that under unequal variances
$$
    \bar Y - \bar X \sim N\left(\mu_y - \mu_x, \frac{\sigma_x^2}{n_x} + \frac{\sigma_y^2}{n_y}\right)
$$
- The statistic 
$$
    \frac{\bar Y - \bar X - (\mu_y - \mu_x)}{\left(\frac{\sigma_x^2}{n_x} + \frac{\sigma_y^2}{n_y}\right)^{1/2}}
$$
approximately follows Gosset's $t$ distribution with degrees of freedom equal to
$$
    \frac{\left(S_x^2 / n_x + S_y^2/n_y\right)^2}
    {\left(\frac{S_x^2}{n_x}\right)^2 / (n_x - 1) +
      \left(\frac{S_y^2}{n_y}\right)^2 / (n_y - 1)}
$$

- $\bar X_{C} = 127.44$ mmHg with $s_{C} = 18.23$ mmHg
- $df=15.04$, $t_{15.04, .975} = 2.13$
- Interval
$$
132.86 - 127.44 \pm 2.13 \left(\frac{15.34^2}{8} + \frac{18.23^2}{21} \right)^{1/2}
= [-8.91, 19.75]
$$

## Steps in a data analysis

* Define the question
* Define the ideal data set
* Determine what data you can access
* Obtain the data
* Clean the data
* Exploratory data analysis
* Statistical prediction/modeling
* Interpret results
* Challenge results
* Synthesize/write up results
* Create reproducible code

## An example

__Start with a general question__

Can I automatically detect emails that are SPAM that are not?

__Make it concrete__

Can I use quantitative characteristics of the emails to classify them as SPAM/HAM?

## Our data set

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/spamR.png height='400' />

[http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/kernlab/html/spam.html](http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/kernlab/html/spam.html)

--- 

## Subsampling our data set
We need to generate a test and training set (prediction)
```{r}
# If it isn't installed, install the kernlab package
library(kernlab)
data(spam)
# Perform the subsampling
set.seed(3435)
trainIndicator = rbinom(4601,size=1,prob=0.5)
table(trainIndicator)
trainSpam = spam[trainIndicator==1,]
testSpam = spam[trainIndicator==0,]
```

---

## Exploratory data analysis

* Look at summaries of the data
* Check for missing data
* Create exploratory plots
* Perform exploratory analyses (e.g. clustering)

---

## Names
```{r}
names(trainSpam)
```


---

## Head
```{r}
head(trainSpam)
```

---

## Summaries
```{r}
table(trainSpam$type)
```

---

## Plots
```{r,fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
plot(trainSpam$capitalAve ~ trainSpam$type)
```

---

## Plots 
```{r, fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
plot(log10(trainSpam$capitalAve + 1) ~ trainSpam$type)
```

---

## Relationships between predictors
```{r, fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
plot(log10(trainSpam[,1:4]+1))
```

---

## Clustering
```{r,echo=FALSE}
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))

```

```{r, fig.height=4,fig.width=4}
hCluster = hclust(dist(t(trainSpam[,1:57])))
plot(hCluster)
```

---
## New clustering
```{r, fig.height =5,fig.width=5}
hClusterUpdated = hclust(dist(t(log10(trainSpam[,1:55]+1))))
plot(hClusterUpdated)
```

---
## Statistical prediction/modeling

* Should be informed by the results of your exploratory analysis
* Exact methods depend on the question of interest
* Transformations/processing should be accounted for when necessary
* Measures of uncertainty should be reported

---
## Statistical prediction/modeling
```{r}
trainSpam$numType = as.numeric(trainSpam$type)-1
costFunction = function(x,y){sum(x!=(y > 0.5))}
cvError = rep(NA,55)
library(boot)
for(i in 1:55){
  lmFormula = as.formula(paste("numType~",names(trainSpam)[i],sep=""))
  glmFit = glm(lmFormula,family="binomial",data=trainSpam)
  cvError[i] = cv.glm(trainSpam,glmFit,costFunction,2)$delta[2]
}
which.min(cvError)
names(trainSpam)[which.min(cvError)]

```

---

## Get a measure of uncertainty
```{r}
predictionModel = glm(numType ~ charDollar,family="binomial",data=trainSpam)
predictionTest = predict(predictionModel,testSpam)
predictedSpam = rep("nonspam",dim(testSpam)[1])
predictedSpam[predictionModel$fitted > 0.5] = "spam"
table(predictedSpam,testSpam$type)
(61+458)/(1346+458 + 61 + 449)

```

---

## Interpret results

* Use the appropriate language
  * describes 
  * correlates with/associated with
  * leads to/causes
  * predicts
* Give an explanation
* Interpret coefficients
* Interpret measures of uncertainty

---

## Our example

* The fraction of charcters that are dollar signs can be used to predict if an email is Spam
* Anything with more than 6.6% dollar signs is classified as Spam
* More dollar signs always means more Spam under our prediction
* Our test set error rate was 22.4% 

---

## Challenge results

* Challenge all steps:
  * Question
  * Data source
  * Processing 
  * Analysis 
  * Conclusions
* Challenge measures of uncertainty
* Challenge choices of terms to include in models
* Think of potential alternative analyses 

---

## Synthesize/write-up results

* Lead with the question
* Summarize the analyses into the story 
* Don't include every analysis, include it
  * If it is needed for the story
  * If it is needed to address a challenge
* Order analyses according to the story, rather than chronologically
* Include "pretty" figures that contribute to the story 

---

## In our example

* Lead with the question
  * Can I use quantitative characteristics of the emails to classify them as SPAM/HAM?
* Describe the approach
  * Collected data from UCI -> created training/test sets
  * Explored relationships
  * Choose logistic model on training set by cross validation
  * Applied to test, 78% test set accuracy
* Interpret results
  * Number of dollar signs seems reasonable, e.g. "Make money with Viagra \\$ \\$ \\$ \\$!"
* Challenge results
  * 78% isn't that great
  * I could use more variables
  * Why logistic regression?

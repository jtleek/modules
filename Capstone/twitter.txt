Predicting Stock Market Returns with Twitter
----------------------------------------

It has been claimed that Twitter can be used to predict movement in the stock market

In this final project you will search for social media discussion of specific stocks using the [twitteR package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) and the searchTwitter function. You will collect stock data for the S & P 500 (or some other subset) using the [quantmod](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html) package. You may find the text mining package [tm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html), [tutorial](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/vignettes/tm.pdf)

Here is an analysis that may be useful trying to analyze sentiment related to airlines [http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/](http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/).

### You must submit

* An R package that runs your code and produces predictions
* A vector of predictions for the returns of the first busines day after the course ends
* A write up of what you did

### You will be graded on:

* 50\% prediction RMSE
* 25\% does your R package compile 
* 25\% peer evaluation of project
  * Is the write up clear?
  * Is the code neatly documented/do what they say
  * Do the claims match the analysis
  * The rest of the rubric

### Optionally

* You can use any other data you want in your prediction
  * Your "other data" must be social media data
  * An example is the stocktwits api [http://stocktwits.com/developers/docs/api#streams-symbol-docs](http://stocktwits.com/developers/docs/api#streams-symbol-docs)
  * You must use twitter data and comment on the relative strength of this data



Digit recognizer
----------------------------------------

Have them write a digit recognizer with this:

[http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

Or we could generate simulated digits. Have them submit an R package, a prediction, and a write-up. 



Breast cancer prognosis
----------------------------------------

Have people predict breast cancer prognosis with publicly available gene expression data (data won't change much but we could rotate a few data sets)

## Replication

* The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence is replication of findings and conducting studies with independent
  - Investigators	
  - Data
  - Analytical methods
  - Laboratories
  - Instruments

* Replication is particularly important in studies that can impact
  broad policy or regulatory decisions

## Whatâ€™s Wrong with Replication?

* Some studies cannot be replicated
  - No time, opportunistic
  - No money
  - Unique

* Reproducible Research: Make analytic data and code available so that
  others may reproduce findings
